# Get-Together-

Fully functional full stack app built with Express & Mongoose that stores data in MongoDB created by Mike, Ian, and Cierra. 

MVP
1. Have at least 2 related models – one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
3. Include sign up/log in functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow, 
4. Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process.
5. Have many sequential commits reflecting carefully adding one functionality at a time.
6. Have semantically clean HTML and CSS
7. Be deployed online and accessible to the public.


USER STORIES
1. User goes to main website page, which has a welcoming message and theme and login. It also contains a description of what our app is and does. 
2. User logs in. Failed logins reroute to main page with message. Login directs to users groups (get togethers) page.
3. Users groups show only their joined groups as a group image with title. Groups are clean looking and modularized. User can click on an existing group to enter that groups show page, or they can create a new group.
4. Group show page will have different templates that group decides to use. Group members can click on an add user button to add friends to their group. They can also click to decide which templates to add to their group from this page. 
5. There will be a log on the group show page that shows users activities from this group. 
6. Group users will be able to push photos into an array that is specific to this group - photos will randomly animate on the page showing a collection of photos added by the group.
7. There will be multiple template options for each group to create and choose from. We will start with group food recipe and group to do lists. Expanding to more templates will be a future release.
8. When a user selects a new template, they open a drop-down which displays template options of recipes of and lists (for now). 
9. Once a user chooses to add or publish a template to the group page, it appears as another icon/module on that user’s groups main page.
10. Recipes Module: The recipes module will include some set recipes for users to choose from, as well as the ability to fill in a pre-styled template to create their own recipes and share to the group page.
11. List Module: The list module will again be a pre-styled template. Users will be able to add/delete/edit list items, as well as click a check box to say they completed that item. checkbox will result in that list item being crossed-out instead of removed.
12. Feed/Sidebar: The sidebar will display a chronological log user posts and activity within that specific group.
